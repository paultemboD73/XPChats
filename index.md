# <h4> A mental health messaging Application
goals: The goal of the application is to create a platform in which individuals suffering from mental issues (conditions) are able to express themselves and have someone to talk to if ever they need anyone. rather then shut off to themselves, they should be able to have someone to interact with and hopefully build a trustworthy bond wiht in confidence
the apllication is to have two main individuals to interact namely;
* GUIDE (Counsellor/Therapist)
* VISITOR (Individual)
key functionalities of the application should include;
* Creating a platform for the vulnerable to be able to express themselves and seek the help they deserve.
* creating a platform in which individuals who wish to help the vulnerable could be able to come on board and to lend the time and efforts
* create an environment where all interactions between guides and visitors are completely confidential unless consent is submitted by the visitor or any other legal reasons
* a platform should also be possible where past survivors of traumatic events could be able to upload there story
the idea is solely none profit however a donations based systems could be implemented in which donations are split fairly between me and the guides
